## ToDo keeper

Keep a simple list of to-do tasks in a text file called todo.txt.

When you finish a task, mark it with *** (three asterisks). After completing a few tasks, run this app in the same folder and it will move all your completed tasks to the end of the same file, keeping all unfinished tasks on top.

Supported markers for finished tasks:
```
***
**-
*--
---
 ***  
  ***
```
